# Favicon Generation Prompt

Use this prompt with a diffusion model (like DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion) to generate a favicon for the One of Us game:

```
A minimalist icon design for a favicon (512x512px). The icon should represent an "Ideological Turing Test" game. Design ideas: two overlapping speech bubbles or thought bubbles in contrasting colors (orange and gray), or a chameleon silhouette, or a simple mask icon, or two mirrored profile silhouettes facing each other. Flat design, modern, playful but not childish. High contrast for small sizes. Simple geometric shapes. Orange (#f97316) as the primary color with gray/black accents. Clean, minimal, recognizable at 16x16 pixels.
```

Alternative shorter prompt:
```
Minimalist flat icon: chameleon or two overlapping speech bubbles, orange and gray, clean geometric shapes, high contrast, modern and playful, 512x512px
```

After generating, resize to these sizes and place in `/public`:
- favicon.ico (32x32)
- icon.svg (or icon.png at 192x192)
- apple-touch-icon.png (180x180)
